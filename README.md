# ML-Housing-Prediction-California



In this project I'll use the Californian Housing Price dataset from the StatLib repository. The dataset is based on data from 1990 California census. The task was to use the California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. This data includes metrics such as the population, median income, and median housing price for each block group in California. 
The goal was that my model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.
